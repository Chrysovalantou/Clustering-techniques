# Clustering-techniques
Implementation of two clustering algorithms: k-Means and Mixture of Gaussians.

Cluster Analysis or Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in
the same group, cluster, are more similar, in some sense or another, to each other than to those in other
groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical
data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, 
information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, and computer graphics.

In this repository you may find the implementation from scratch, in Python, of two major clustering algorithms:
k-Means & Mixture of Gaussians.

This work has been done as part of the class "Methods in Bioinformatics" during my M.Sc. studies in Bioinformatics
Graduate program, at the University of Crete, GR.
